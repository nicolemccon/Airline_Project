# Contribution 

Mark - Testing
Madhura - Coding (count_seats, empy_seats_check) 
Nicole - Coding (seat_rows, max_seats, booking, refused_separated)


# Implementation:

Python and SQLite

Though this can also be implemented using other databases, only the care that will have to be taken is some parameters for connection and certain libraries will have to be imported.
We have used SQLite because the team has an understanding of sql and SQLite provides functionality for data to be imported from CSV files which makes slicing and dicing(data handling easy).

# Assumptions: 

- The layout of the plane is consistent 
  - For example, if 
- Passengers are considered "separated" if for example a group of 4 is split into 2 in one row and 2 in another (TBC) 
- Can we update the database in one fell swoop at the end or can we make use of lists to do it all at once? (TBC)
  - the outline does say after each booking has been processed, update the separated/refused, so perhaps not 
  
# Testing
The testing carried out has been covered in the separate document entitled "Airline Testing" (TBC).
