ARI Airline Programming Assignment


Assumptions: 

- The layout of the plane is consistent 
  - i.e. if the first row has 2 seats in either aisle (4 seats per row), then all rows are consistent in that layout
- Passengers are considered "separated" if for example a group of 4 is split into 2 in one row and 2 in another (TBC) 
- Can we update the database in one fell swoop at the end or can we make use of lists to do it all at once? (TBC)
  - the outline does say after each booking has been processed, update the separated/refused, so perhaps not
